# Cryptozoology that everyone can understand (people of insight are welcome to contribute)

The goal of this book is to simplify cryptography, which is difficult to understand, so that more people can understand cryptography and become interested in cryptography. To read this book, you need to have a certain mathematical theoretical foundation. The cryptography in the book will describe the logic of cryptography with diagrams and simple and easy-to-understand language.

### [About this book](./preface/README.md) -->


This book is currently in the writing stage, and its version is temporarily set to V1.0.1. This book will always follow the development of cryptography technology and will be updated at any time. The content of this book will be updated simultaneously on the author's blog and public account. The content may not be consistent, so I hope readers will bear with me. Due to the limited level of the author who wrote this book, if you have any doubts in the book, you can raise them for discussion.
